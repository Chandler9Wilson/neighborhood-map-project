## Questions:

1. How do i not reveal the client_secret when the app is client side only atm?
2. Places Autocomplete runs but is not displaying suggestions I found a [thread with a similar issue but in a bootstrap modal](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10957781/google-maps-autocomplete-result-in-bootstrap-modal-dialog)
I have tried several of the suggested solutions but nothing has worked so far not sure what I am missing.
3. Part of the map is pushed off the page when in fullscreen desktop. I have not been able to figure out if this is an issue with mdl or how I am declaring the map properties in css
